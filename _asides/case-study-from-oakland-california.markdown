_This case study was first presented by Jason Willis and Matt Hill in [Voices in Urban Education](http://annenberginstitute.org/sites/default/files/product/198/files/VUE29.pdf). The authors are former employees of Oakland Unified School District's central office._

The Oakland Unified School District started transitioning from centralized budgeting to student-based budgeting in 2004 when total enrollment was around 50,000.

Prior to reform, the school district was driven by top-down compliance-oriented management that implemented a one-size-fits-all strategy based on staffing allocations. Rather than a supply and demand relationship between central office and individual schools, central office would identify needs and provide them to schools. There was little feedback from schools and little transparency in budgeting information.

After shifting to student-based budgeting the district implemented many changes, including the following:

+ The main compliance document, called the _Single Plan for Student Achievement_, was transformed into a three-year strategic planning tool.

+ Data standardization and access was prioritized. The district held training for school communities to use data and develop strategies to address the learning needs of different student groups.

+ Training was provided for central office staff on service delivery.

+ A two-way accountability system was implemented. Schools were scored based on student outcomes. Central office was scored on how well it served schools.


Following the transition toward student-based budgeting, the authors found that a more strategic culture developed along long-term planning and better resource allocation. Principals felt more supported, which grew in part out of a collaborative relationship between schools and central office. The budget department became more innovative in communicating with both external and internal stakeholders.

"Culture change in an urban school system is possible, but it takes consistent investments of resources and human capital over a consistent period of time," the study's authors concluded.
