**Train teachers and administrative staff to work with students who have had adverse childhood experiences**

Many students have adverse childhood experiences that can follow them into adulthood. But not every student has access to resources that support his or her needs, whether they be emotional, social, or behavioral.

Hamilton County should provide additional staff and training so schools may better provide aid and intervention to these students. Trauma-informed schools can create more supportive learning environments that are respectful of a student's diverse experiences.

A community school model can provide students and families counseling, mental health screenings, and social and behavioral support. A school capable of addressing a wider range of needs helps ensure students attend with a readiness to learn.
