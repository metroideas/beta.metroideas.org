**Redraw school zones for greater socioeconomic diversity**

Concentrated poverty in nearly half of Hamilton County schools, as well as homogenous student populations, contributes to gaps in academic achievement and educational attainment. County officials should diversify our schools to improve student outcomes and benefit all students, regardless of race or socioeconomic status.

While race cannot be used to determine school enrollment, socioeconomic status can. There are several methods worth exploring:

+ School zone boundaries can be redrawn to achieve more diverse student bodies.
+ District-wide school choice could be paired with algorithms to ensure diversity goals are met for every school.
+ Diversity-focused enrollment could be used to create magnet and charter schools.

Regardless of method, school segregation is one of the most critical challenges facing our district. Officials should face it with a community-driven approach that meets the diverse needs of our students.
