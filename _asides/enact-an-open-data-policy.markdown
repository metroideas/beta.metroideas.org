**Establish guidelines requiring county offices to make data available to the public**

Hamilton County manages large troves of data about its operations. Little of this information is publicly available or presented in formats that can be viewed by the average person. However, data about the county's finances, schools, and services has value to citizens and the government itself.

The county should adopt an open data policy that outlines how offices and departments can make this information available. A policy would prompt the publication of data that improves government efficiency, bolsters accountability, and promotes civic engagement.
