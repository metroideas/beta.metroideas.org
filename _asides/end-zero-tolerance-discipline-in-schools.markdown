**Adopt discipline policies that approach conflict through nonpunitive methods**

Zero-tolerance discipline practices tend to be racially biased and cause retraumatization of many students. Schools with concentrated poverty have much higher rates of suspension and expulsion. In Hamilton County, black students are up to nine times more likely to be kicked out of school than those of other races.

These practices should be eliminated in our schools and replaced with healthier, more equitable methods. Restorative justice seeks to respect student experiences and approaches conflict through nonpunitive methods like mediation. These methods would enforce a culture that respects students, regardless of race or income.
