**Create a summer reading program for middle and high school students**

The state of Tennessee has partnered with Dolly Parton's Imagination Library to improve third-graders' literacy rates. Nearly 70 percent of Hamilton County children are enrolled in the program.

County officials should build on this model and establish a summer reading program that provides free books to middle and high school students. Summer reading has been shown to have a significant, positive effect on literacy rates and overall academic success among students of low socioeconomic statuses.
