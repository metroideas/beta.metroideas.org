**Appropriate education dollars to match student needs**

Equitable school funding gives students, regardless of background, the same chance to succeed in the classroom. More dollars donâ€™t necessarily guarantee better test scores, but when schools are short on money, they may struggle to create optimal learning environments.

Some students cost more to educate than others. A one-size-fits-all budgeting process does not account for the educational needs of a large, diverse student population.

Hamilton County officials should implement a student-based funding model that ensures students have equal opportunities in the classroom. This effort should be paired with greater principal autonomy to determine how school dollars are spent.
