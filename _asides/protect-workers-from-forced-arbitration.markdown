**Limit forced arbitration agreements by county contractors and vendors**

The Supreme Court has determined that employers can take away an employee's right to a court trial under the Federal Arbitration Act. However, local governments can set guidelines for how these clauses are implemented, enforced, and reported by contractors and vendors.

Hamilton County can become a leader in worker protections. It can refuse to do business with companies that put forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Alternatively, it could require vendors to disclose its arbitration clauses or require companies to issue waivers from these clauses for county-specific jobs.
