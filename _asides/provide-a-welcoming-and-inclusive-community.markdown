**Ensure county resources are available for non-English speakers**

The rate of small business creation has been declining in most American cities. When business creation stalls, so does community growth. However, immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start their own businesses than native-born Americans. We should be focused on providing a welcoming and inclusive community for these entrepreneurs.

Hamilton County should implement strategies that support inclusion. Local government agencies should offer translation services that make its resources available in other languages, online and off. The county should create an office that works with nonprofit organizations to coordinate immigrant inclusion initiatives such as naturalization.
