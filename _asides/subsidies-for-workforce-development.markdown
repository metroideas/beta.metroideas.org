**Help small businesses train workers in new skills**

While major employers like Volkswagen and McKee Foods continually invest in their workforces, smaller companies struggle to let workers off to develop skills and pursue additional training. Yet these new skills could boost companies' bottom lines down the road and contribute to higher wages.

A county workforce development incentive would provide small businesses tax credits to offset the cost of training workers and loss of production. Industry certifications are valuable, transferable, and wealth-generating. They can spur entrepreneurship and boost salaries for workers.

An "earn-as-you-learn" model would pair older and familiar apprenticeships with modern, equity-focused policies. When combined with other economic programs, these subsidies would be part of a comprehensive economic system that helps modernize our workforce and allows it to adapt to changing criteria and skill requirements.
