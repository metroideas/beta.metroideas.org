**Require governing boards to publish quarterly reports on property tax incentives**

Hamilton County and the city of Chattanooga provide property tax abatements to more than fifty entities. These agreements are often contentious amongst citizens and some local officials. There is little public information available about them, and the companies that receive them have few reporting requirements.

The County Commission, in concert with city officials and related governing boards, should enact a resolution requiring regular updates on tax abatements and subsidies. The information should be published on a standalone website and updated at least quarterly.

One model for this is a joint initiative from the city of Memphis, Shelby County, and the area's industrial development board. EDGE provides clear data, records, and information about these agreementsâ€”their cost to taxpayers, as well as their benefits to the region.
