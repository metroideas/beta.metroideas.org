**Partner with accounting students and nonprofits to provide free tax-filing services**

Federal tax refunds are often a much-needed inflow of cash for many residents. Yet tax preparation can be daunting and difficult to get right.

This is unfortunate because predatory businesses often use tax season to take advantage of low-income residents. These companies offer tax form assistance in exchange for a large cut of an individual's return.

A better alternative would be for the county and its municipalities to partner with a local university's accounting students and other
organizations to provide free tax preparation and wealth-management services. This program would help low-income residents get their full returns, provide real-world training for students, and give nonprofits leads on residents to work with on other wealth-building strategies.
