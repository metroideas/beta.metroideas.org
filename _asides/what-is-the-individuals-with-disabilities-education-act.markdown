[IDEA](http://idea.ed.gov/) ensures early intervention, special education and related services to 6.5 million infants, toddlers, children and youth with disabilities in the U.S. Prior to the law's passage in 1975, only [one in five children](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/idea/history.pdf) with a disability received a school education. Many states had laws that excluded children who were deaf, blind, emotionally disturbed or intellectually disabled from attending school.

In Hamilton County, nearly [13 percent of students have a disability](https://www.tn.gov/education/topic/data-downloads). Of these students, [58 percent](https://www.tn.gov/education/topic/data-downloads) go on to graduate. Hamilton County received roughly [$10 million in IDEA grants](https://www.tn.gov/assets/entities/education/attachments/asr_1415.pdf) in 2015.
