[Title I funding](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg1.html) is intended "to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards and state academic assessments."

Originally part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and now under the No Child Left Behind Act, Title I federal funds are targeted at closing the achievement gap between low-income and other students. Almost [14,000 of the 15,000 school districts](https://www.naeyc.org/policy/federal/title1) in the nation conduct Title I programs. Funds are distributed on a formula basis, which aims to provide resources to schools and students with the greatest need. [Four formulas](http://atlas.newamerica.org/no-child-left-behind-act-title-i-distribution-formulas) are used: the Basic Grant, Concentration Grant, Targeted Assistance Grant and the Education Finance Incentive Grant.

Funds are distributed to school districts, which have some discretion in how they allocate Title I money to schools. Examples of how funds might be used include professional development for teachers, curriculum improvement, providing additional help for students and promoting parent involvement. In schools where more than half of students are considered low-income, a "schoolwide program" can be implemented with the goal of using Title I money to improve achievement for all students.

In Hamilton County, schools where over 50 percent of students who are economically disadvantaged receive Title I funds. This qualifies over 50 public schools for Title I funds. While this supports the majority of students in the county, the system overlooks some students in need. Schools a little under the 50 percent threshold donâ€™t receive the same federal support as schools that qualify for Title I funds. Schools in the Title I gap include Loftis Middle School (40.8 percent economically disadvantaged), STEM School (41.4), Ooltewah High (42.1), McConnell Elementary (44.2), Sale Creek Middle/High (46.1), Ganns Middle Valley Elementary (46.8) and Allen Elementary (47.7).

The Hamilton County Department of Education has a [list of Title I schools](http://www.hcde.org/?PN=Pages&SubP=Level1Page&L=2&DivisionID=14285&DepartmentID=15178&PageID=20951&ToggleSideNav=ShowAll).
