[Depends](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/rural_locales.asp) [on](http://www.census.gov/population/metro/data/metrodef.html) [who](http://www.livable.org/storage/documents/reports/Other/The_Mid-Sized_City_Exploring_its_Unique_Place_in_Urban_Policy.pdf) [you](http://urbanland.uli.org/economy-markets-trends/the-fading-differentiation-between-city-and-suburb/) [ask](http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/what-defines-city). At the Metro Ideas Project, we define a midsize city as a municipality with a population between 75,000 and 500,000.

We quickly realized there is no perfect set of boundaries that best fit a specific taxonomy of place. For example, where a small town ends and where a midsize city begins is a pretty tough and subjective call. But our range grants us the flexibility to study a wide range of cities without including mega-cities or rural townships.
