      <h2>Big ideas for small cities</h2>
      <p>There are over 400 American cities with populations between 75,000 and 500,000 residents, but there are few resources to help these communities tackle the big policy challenges they face. We aim to meet this need by providing smart ideas and sound research to strengthen the nation’s midsize cities.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">We’re committed to being an accessible resource for local communities</h2>
      <p>Metro Ideas Project is a nonpartisan, independent public policy research organization that strives to identify and address the pressing issues facing American cities by conducting sound research, sparking informed policy discussion and providing practical recommendations.</p>
      <p>The ideas, debates and proposals that are sparked by good policy research are key to building better cities. Today, research can’t just be locked away in an inaccessible and lengthy document with the expectation that its conclusions will trickle down to policymakers and the public. To foster the next generation of engaged civic actors, we strive to design research projects that connect to our lives in a way that’s meaningful and compelling.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">Our research agenda is driven by five key factors</h2>
      <p>To make the most of our resources, we determine the policy focus of each research project through a careful review of some core qualities. There are several factors that help us find policy challenges and research opportunities that we can add value to our work:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Local impact</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Data availability</li>
        <li>Engaged stakeholders</li>
        <li>Relevance</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Additionally, we look for policy areas that we are personally passionate about as a team and see if there is an opportunity for further study. That creative spark combined with qualitative data from community leaders is what determines the particular policy areas we choose to focus on.</p>

      <p>Diversity in thought, experience and ideology are core to our mission of building a new kind of research organization that values the best ideas over rigid political agendas. The Metro Ideas Project's financial supporters have no influence over any aspect of research project design, analysis, findings or recommendations.</p>
      <p>We are a 501(c)(3) nonpartisan organization that neither makes endorsements nor engages in electioneering.</p>

      <p>Metro Ideas Project closed a "philanthropic seed round" in October 2015. The partners at Lamp Post Group provided a grant to launch and fund the organization for two years.</p>
      <p>Additional funding will expand our capabilities and provide the opportunity for broader impact. All future contributions will be publicly acknowledged and listed online. The Metro Ideas Project will consider granting anonymity to individual funders who request it, subject to an internal review that determines the best interests of the organization and the funder with regard to integrity, our credibility and the law.</p>
