project: The cost of education
---

<section class="description">
  <p>The Metro Ideas Project spent the past four months researching <a href="/blog/one-answer-many-questions/">how much it costs to educate students</a> at every school in Hamilton County, Tennessee.</p>
  
  <p>The Hamilton County Department of Education spent around $400 million in the 2014â€“15 school year on more than 42,000 students. Our research shows how approximately 75 percent of the school system budget, or $300 million, is divided among schools.</p>

  <p>We organized the results by the county's nine legislative districts.</p>
