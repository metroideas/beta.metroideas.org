_Wonk Wednesdays are happy hours all about public policy and the ideas that drive it. We choose a big question or theme to spark lively dialog about the issues that impact us most in our local communities. This month's topic is a community food incubator, which could help diversify Chattanooga's food and entreprenurial scenes._

Chattanooga's renaissance has shown the value of incubators and accelerators for entrepreneurs. We've seen success in the tech sector, where public and philanthropic dollars have helped grow a thriving ecosystem for innovative companies. 

Unfortunately, diversity has not accompanied this rapid growth. This is disappointing. Immigrants are [almost twice as likely](https://metroideas.org/blog/diversify-chattanoogas-economy-with-a-food-incubator/) to start their own businesses than native-born Americans. New small businesses are critical to communities. But other than major metropolitan hubs, the rate of firm creation is steadily declining.

Chattanooga must explore options to reverse that trend. Starting an incubation space for immigrant- and minority-owned food businesses could be the answer. A Chattanooga food incubator would help diversify the list of successful entrepreneurs by opening up the prospect of running a business to a broader range of individuals from more diverse demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. 

Small business incubators already exist in Chattanooga, but they are not focused on some of the upfront costs that are unique to restaurants. A food incubator could provide a smoother path for aspiring restaurateurs and significantly diversify the food economy.

Join us as we discuss the idea of an incubator focused on immigrant- and minority-owned restaurants and what that could mean for the city.
