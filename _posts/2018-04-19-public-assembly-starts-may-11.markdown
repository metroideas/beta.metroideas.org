Metro Ideas Project and the Aspen Institute Socrates Program will host a two-day conference in Chattanooga, Tennessee, that focuses on bridging divisions among urban, suburban, and rural communities. 

[Public Assembly](http://www.apublicassembly.com) is a gathering of politicians, journalists, and thinkers who are tackling tough national challenges in unique and innovative ways. The event will be held May 11â€“12 at Chattanooga Whiskey and the Edney Innovation Center.

The speaker lineup includes:

+ Sandhya Dirks and Devin Katayama, reporters for KQED
+ Justin Gest, assistance professor of public policy at George Mason University
+ Gabriel Metcalf, president and CEO of SPUR
+ Robinson Meyer, staff writer for The Atlantic
+ Mark Stodola, mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas

The inaugural summit will focus on a single theme, "Bridging the Urban-Suburban-Rural Divide." Many of the divisions among these communities are intertwined with important policy and political debates currently shaping the national landscape. Instead of exacerbating conflicts, we want to host a conversation that can begin to bridge them.

Event registration includes a limited open bar and hors d'oeuvres Friday and Saturday evenings. Breakfast and lunch will be provided Saturday. 

Student and educator discounts are available. See the [registration page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/public-assembly-2018-tickets-44022713120) for details.
