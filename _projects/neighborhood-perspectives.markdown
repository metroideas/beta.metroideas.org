## How can we build a more equitable Chattanooga? Let's start with neighborhoods.

They are the building blocks of a city. Over time, they change in subtle ways. They can also transform rapidly in response to new trends, investment or challenges.

Neighborhoods face big, often-contentious questions:

{: .long-list}
+ When does development cross the line between progress and gentrification?
+ What makes housing affordable for a broad range of residents? 
+ How can we encourage development without compromising a neighborhood's essential qualities?

For this series, Metro Ideas Project is exploring the character of Chattanooga's neighborhoods. Some pieces are educational and informative. Others look at outside-the-box strategies to strengthen our communities.

Our goal is to prompt serious thought and debate around making our neighborhoods more equitableâ€”a discussion we believe can be extended to the region at large.
