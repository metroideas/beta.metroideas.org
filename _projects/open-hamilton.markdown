Transparency, accountability, efficiency â€” these are core values that should drive public service. A robust open data policy is one tool governments are increasingly adopting to meet them.

Open data offers many benefits:

\+ Leads to better policy decisions\
\+ Creates internal efficiencies\
\+ Drives transparency and accountability\
\+ Reduces barriers to information\
\+ Drives citizen engagement\
\+ Fuels economic and community development

The government of Hamilton County, Tennessee, does not have a clear open data policy in place. It publishes some data and records on its website, but there is room for improvement.

Metro Ideas Project interviewed county officials and representatives of cities and counties that have implemented open data policies.

Our open data toolkit includes three case studies looking at how other local governments have transitioned to open data policies, practical applications for open data, and guidelines to help county officials get started on this important work.
