## Tennessee Profiles

The opportunity zones program is an ambitious new program to drive capital to distressed communities by steering deferred capital gains to opportunity funds that were determined by US governors across the country.

These zones could have substantial impacts on their communities, by spurring an inflow of capital to areas that would not traditionally attract substantial investment. As investors and communities begin to prepare to build the infrastructure to best take advantage of this new initiative, Metro Ideas Project has profiled each of the qualified opportunity zones in Tennessee.

This guide is designed to help residents, investors, and key community stakeholders guide opportunity funds to projects that will help foster thriving communities. While a high-level overview, this guide can be used to assess the individual strengths and gaps of an opportunity zone relative to the potential investments that opportunity funds may pursue.
